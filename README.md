Dreamcatcher is a blog like online dream journal, every morning you wake up you can log your dream right here so you never forget!

I approached this like a tumblr for dreams essentially. Easy posts/edits/deletes and very simple to use.

I wanted to make it possible to favorite certain dreams but I was never able to get to it.

I was unable to get the seed route to work properly.
